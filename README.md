PRIME is a variant of Zap'M started in March 2011 by Psiweapon. Michał joined in late October 2011. Development continued until the end of 2014.

some changes compared to the original 2.5a:

bring the sealed profession "orc cracker" back to live.
actually it's nearly completed in 2.5a but never published.
I just free it from comments and give it a new weapon cashpistol.
cashpistol uses buckazoids as ammo and shoots twice in one action.

(2025/12/6)add some new weapons from Predators: Badlands

on reporting bug:

everyone is welcome to report bugs here but don't expect me to fix them.
let's hope for someone smarter than me to do this...

known bugs:

picking up space trash (why would you do this?) could crash the game

installation issues:

I have only tried compiling the code on Ubuntu22.04.
not sure if there are any problems on other system.
if you want to change the installation directory, make sure to change both makefile and src/gen/config.h
the game would need some places for save and score files. but it won't make the directory everytime (very strange).
should the game say any directories lost, just make it by yourself.
